# Online-Training-Course-FLASK
Online training course website developed using Flask

The project team of developers has been tasked to envision and create a "user-friendly" and "minimalist" aesthetically pleasing commercial website, for a hugely popular and thriving “Online Training Course” business based in "Luton, London". This site would be used to advertise and sell Scrum and other computer science-related certification courses via the internet, as well as non-certification courses. 
Some of the courses are delivered at specific training centres/locations, while others are via the internet.
It is up to the Scrum project team, to decide what your website is called, what it looks like, what information goes onto the page etc., but you have to be able to get your ideas across to and collaborate with the stakeholder — the Product Owner, who will, in addition, provide you with a specification of the core features that the business would want included in the new site.
